About aria2

aria2 is a utility for downloading files.
The supported protocols are HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink.
aria2 can download a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum download bandwidth.
It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP /SFTP and BitTorrent at the same time,
while the data downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm.
Using Metalink chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks of data while downloading a file.
